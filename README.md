## About
A collection of projects from a few of my courses at Cleveland State University.  

| Course | Semester    | Language | Requirements                              |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| CIS430 | Spring 2017 | SQL      | Microsoft SQL Server 2014                 |
| EEC487 | Fall 2015   | VHDL     | Altera DE1 FPGA, Altera Quartus v 13 sp 1 |

This isn't an actively maintained project. I originally used individual GitHub repositories for each of my courses throughout the semesters, but after I graduated I tried to switch over to just one repository for everything. Unfortunately most of my coursework is either unpresentable (early CS coursework from back when I was a fool) or lost forever (died with the hard drive on my college laptop before I could clean it up for Github).

This isn't an actively maintained project. I left it up to help friends at my alma mater after I graduated.

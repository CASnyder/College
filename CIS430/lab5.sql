Part 1: Views

/*
1-1) Create a view named VDept_Headcount that reports headcount for each department.
	The report includes 3 columns as follow:
		Dept_Name

Show the content of the view through SQL (Select * from VDept_Headcount;)

1-2)
Add yourself to the database (to Employee table). Then Show the content of your view again to

/*
1-3)
Then Change your view to add two more pieces of information â€“ Sum_Salary, Ave_Salary for each department. Include all
the departments. Your report (view) lists 5 Columns as follows:
Dept_Name, Dept_Number, No_Emp, Sum_Salary, Ave_Salary

/*=================================================
Part 2: Stored Procedures using Cursors
=================================================*/

/*

Write a Stored Procedure SP_Report_NEW_Budget using the view created in
Part 1-3). 

Stored Procedure SP_Report_ NEW_Budget does the following tasks:
Creates a new table NEW_Dept_Budget as follow:
	NEW_Dept_Budget has 5 columns
		Dept_No (Int)
		Dept_Name (Char(30))
		COUNT_Emp (INT)
		New_SUM_Salary (INT)
		New_AVE_Salary (INT)

2-1) Check if the view VDept_Budget is empty or not (by counting rows from the view).
2-2) If not empty , For each row of the view VDept_Budget, Calculate New_SUM_Salary,
	New_AVE_Salary as follow:
	If Dept = 1, Increase SUM(salary) 10%
	If Dept = 4, Increase SUM(salary) 20%
	If Dept = 5, Increase SUM(salary) 30%
	If Dept = 7, Increase SUM(salary) 40%
2-3) Insert each column value into the new table NEW_Dept_Budget.

CIS 430: Database Concepts
Professor:  Dr. Sunnie (Sun) Chung

>The course introduces fundamental concepts for design and use of
modern database systems. It explores a number of areas such as database design process,
conceptual modeling of data, converting conceptual data representations to a relational
database scheme, use of the relational database language SQL to create database and to
write SQL statements for insert, delete, update and retrieve data. The course also
introduces some of the fundamental file system that is used as physical data storage and
index structures in relational database systems. The course introduces database
programming with stored procedure, functions, cursor, and triggers. The course extends
to modern database processing in distributed database systems - client server database
programming - Embedded SQL, Dynamic SQL with JDBC/ODBC and building database
and web service applications with PHP. The course also introduces View and Transaction
concept. Finally the course advances with introduction of Semi-structured Database
concept with XML and Data Warehouse concept. 

This repo includes everything I developed & turned in for CIS 430 during the Spring semester of 2017.

* All work was done using Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Management Studio
* Eventually I'll go through and add professor / TA comments to each project

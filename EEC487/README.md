# EEC487 - Advanced Digital Systems

Course description from my old syllabus:

>Coverage includes CPLD/FPGA devices, digital design methodology, VHDL hardware description language, VHDL description for combinational circuits, sequential circuits, FSM (finite state machine) and FSMD (finite state machine with datapath).

This repo includes all the code my lab partners and I developed + turned in for EEC 487 in Fall of 2015 as well as the PDF descriptions + rubrics for each lab. 

+ All the work was done using Altera Quartus design software v 13 sp 1.
+ All VHDL was written for an Altera DE1 Board. 
+ Any additional comments on my projects - comments from the professor, personal opinions on what I turned in, known errors - will be under separate readme's in the project

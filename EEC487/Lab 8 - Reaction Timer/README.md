# Lab 8 - Reaction Timer

This code is severely half-done.

By this point in the semester my partners and I had a 90 average across all our labs and on our midterm, and since our professor dropped the lowest lab score we decided to just drop this lab since we couldn't get it working. 

Also Fallout 4 had just dropped and all of us bought it. 

Not the most flattering moment in my academic career. I know.
